<h2>Exclusive meeting with Dani Michelle, stylist to the stars and now jewelry designer</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph"><strong>Vogue.</strong> What’s your earliest jewelry memory?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph"><strong>Dani Michelle.</strong> “I think my earliest memory is when I was 13, when my grandfather, who I didn’t know very well at the time, gave me a heart-shaped necklace for my birthday. I remember staring at it, thinking it was the most meaningful gift he could give me. I knew it was something I would have forever, that I could wear as a token of his love."</p>

            <h2>Dani Michelle</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph"><strong>What is your most treasured piece of jewelry?</strong> The piece that is closest to my heart is a solid gold flat link bracelet that my grandmother used to wear. It is one of the main inspirations for our current collection, and it always reminds me of her.</p>

            <h2>What is the one you never leave home without?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">I never leave home without all my rings.</p>

            <h2>How did your brand MÉGÀ come about?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">It was actually Vogue who called me a “Megawatt” stylist, and at that moment I knew it was time to spread my wings further. I called my mother and asked her if she would create a line with me since she is an expert in jewelry.</p>

            <h2>How has your own style influenced your jewelry?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">My own style is timeless, cool, and sophisticated. I hope that’s what MEGÀ also exudes. I like to mix metals and stack them. In this sense, we designed the jewelry to be worn together and layered. In fact, each piece is part of a collective vision.</p>

            <h2>Who would you like to see wearing your jewelry?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">I dream of Kate Moss wearing our MEGA pieces. We actually have a model named after her.</p>

            <h2>What piece of jewelry do you think will enhance even the simplest outfit?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">A good pair of earrings will complete any outfit. They can even take your outfit from day to night. The bigger they are, the more festive they are. Choose them with a few extra diamonds and you're done!</p>

            <h2>What jewelry piece do you think is the most daring? And how do you make it your own?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Maxi earrings here too! But all the jewelry we wear is. No matter how you wear it, it becomes yours. And because it reveals a little bit of your personality, it is daring.</p>

            <h2>What advice would you give to someone who is averse to wearing jewelry or only wears classic pieces?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">I would start with a snake chain like our Omega necklace. It is timeless, chic, and minimalist. It manages to add allure to a look without overdoing it thanks to the shimmer of gold, while being very easy to wear.</p>

            <h2>What are the 3 pieces that a woman should always have in her jewelry box?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Large earrings, again, smaller models, and a ring to wear on the little finger.</p>

            <h2>For a first jewelry investment, what piece would you recommend?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">Again, I would say a snake chain necklace. It can be worn every day or to enhance more formal looks. I wear three of them and I never take them off.</p>

            <h2>What are MÉGÀ’s next projects?</h2>
            <p class="article-paragraph">An upcoming collaboration with a girl who inspires me a lot. To be continued.</p>
